 dog game

Made a prototype of a game about petting a dog, in order to learn Godot :)
I wanted the game to feature some of my favorite game mechanics from nintendogs, the tamagotchi and other lifesim type games!

At this point in development, you can
- Pet the dog to make a stat called "love" increase
  (This updates a heart in the corner, and makes tiny hearts appear!)
- Feed the dog with a bowl
- Watch the dog fall asleep when energy is low
- Clean up dog poop
- Click the placeholder "play" and "go for walk" buttons to trade energy with fun!
