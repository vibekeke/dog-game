 dog game

Started making a game about petting a dog, in order to learn Godot :)
I want the game to feature some of my favorite game mechanics from nintendogs, the tamagotchi and other lifesim type games!

So far into development, you can
- Pet the dog to make a stat called "love" increase
- Feed the dog with a bowl (work in progress)
- Watch the dog fall asleep when energy is low
- Click the placeholder "play" and "go for walk" buttons to trade energy for fun
  These buttons will be replaced with more complex mechanics later on
